Facial Paralysis Analysis using Vision Transformer
This repository contains the code and documentation for a project aimed at detecting and analyzing facial paralysis using Vision Transformers. Vision Transformers (ViT) leverage transformer architecture, originally designed for natural language processing, to process and analyze image data.

Overview
Facial paralysis, such as Bell's palsy, can significantly impact a person's quality of life. Early and accurate detection is crucial for effective treatment. This project employs Vision Transformers to analyze facial images and detect signs of paralysis.
